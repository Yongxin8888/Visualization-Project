# Visualization-Project
CASA0003-Mini group project

my basic idea is 
1. How does the coronavirus spread all around the world?
Represent the spread route in china (1st map) and the whole world(2nd map), 
Add a time progress bar to show the distribution range in time order.  (1th lable)
Add a line chart (2nd lable) to show the increasing trend in recent three months
(Line chart and Pie chart changes together with maps)
 
2. Which areas have the most serious situation?
Heat map to present the distribution of coronavirus in different countries or cities around the world. Dark colours mean large amount of confirm cases while light colours present less cases.(3rd map).        Also can be applied based on death rate (4th map)

3.what is the people behaviour in some areas(London, Wuhan,milan)
Some cities have lockdown but there are still some people go outside. Drawing a map to their movement or active track in the city.(5th map)
